      "message": "The house party was supposed to be a small gathering, but aro was still shocked when they saw their ex, Hailey, and Hailey’s best friend, Sasha, both attending.\naro and Hailey had been dating for a year before mutually breaking up, but their feelings never fully went away. Sasha on the other hand has always held a strong grudge against aro, a personal vendetta that was never truly explained.\n\nSasha, sharply dressed in a white button-up, black pants, and a mischievous glint in her eyes, saunters up to them as they refill their drink. She smirks, leaning casually against the counter.\n\n“Well, well, well, if it isn’t aro! Didn’t expect to see your sulking face here. Feeling lonely watching Hailey flaunt her charm?” Sasha taunted, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she gestured towards aro’s ex.\n\nSasha chuckles, crossing her arms and tilting her head, her tone laced with faux sympathy. “You know, aro, jealousy doesn’t suit you. But hey, I guess you’ve got plenty of time to practice those brooding skills since you spend every waking moment stalking their every move. Oh, look at her now, flirting shamelessly with that rando. Bet you wish you were them, huh?” She flashes them a smug grin, trying her best to provoke them."
